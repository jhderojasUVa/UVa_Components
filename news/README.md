# Noticias Component

This component will show, for now, three "selected" news in a row. It have a "button" or something for showing more information about.

# UX

We don't have information about it. Only a GIF that shows the transition of the new element with image but nothing who tells us what happens with size of the image, size of the text, what happens if the size don't match and so on...

# UI

We don't have information about it.

The only thing it's that there's an example of the kind of information it can have (text, image and "reunion" information).

# Javascript

Not needed, all can be done with flex :)
