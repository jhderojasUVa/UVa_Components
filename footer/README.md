# Footer component

A footer. On this case have three sub elements. A map, which we don't really knows what is inside (but a map is cool). A typical place where to put a lot of links, a suscribe form with social icons and a catchword. And, last, a place where to put the legal info.

# UI

What you see is what you get.

# UX

No info about this.

# SCSS

```
scss/footer.scss (where the footer relays)
```

# Javascript

I hope that a javascript file will be needed if we use the Google Maps API in order to show whatever on the map. But at least it's a "iframe" (something nothing usefull in the future).
