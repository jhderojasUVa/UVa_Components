# Images component

Yes!, this is the most important component component of the world and can save you for thousand of testing hours (no, I'm joking).

This is the most simple component, the image component. This component will show... an image!

# UI

I think we don't need it... but who knows.

# UX

Well, showing an image almost have a great UX inside... well, really only two. Full size (you know, from side to side of the web browser) and image contained in the width of the page.

# SCSS

```
scss/images.scss (the only and one css inside all)
```

We only use one SCSS because, who knows... and if the image doesn't fit on where it is because the image is shorter, web have "to do something" to increase in size.

So we have used CSS3 with viewport units and the great object-fit property in order to maintain his ratio :)

# Javascript

Do you think we need it?
