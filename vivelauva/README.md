# Agenda component

This component will show (at least) 4 elements of the UVa agenda with an image, showing the category of the element and the title (and the date, of course).

## UI

Nothing important here.

## UX

We don't have UX for this element.

## SCSS

```
scss/vivelauva.scss (the styles)
```

After importing the usual things (fonts and colors with their mixins) we put a layer over bootstrap (an small layer) to put things in the correct way.

## Javascript

Nothing!.
